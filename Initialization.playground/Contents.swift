// Create a structure called Fahrenheit
// It should have a variable of temperature with type double
// and an initialization method that sets temp to 32


// Create a structure called celsius
// it should have a variable called temperatureInCelsius that is a double
// create two initialisation methods, one that takes fahrenheight
// and converts it to celsius (num - 32) / 1.8
// one that takes kelvin and converts it to celsius (-273.15)



// Create a class called Question

// and a method that prints wheels = that var
// then create a inheriting class of type bike

// Create a class called Food that has a variable called name
// Name is a String
// add a initialisation method that takes a string and assigns it to name
// add another initialiser to cover if a string isn't included it should call the above method



// Create a struct for animal that has a constant set to species

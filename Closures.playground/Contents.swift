import UIKit

// Create an array of strings / names

// Create a function called backwards that takes two strings, compares whether one
// is greater than the other and returns a bool
// then pass that function to sorted to sort the array


// Create an empty array of strings
// Rather than passing backwards to sorted by
// pass a closure that does the same and assign it to the var


// The closure you wrote defines data types
// but Swift can infer these types due to sorted(by:) knowing what
// it is being called on. The by tells it you are passing a function.
// So repeat the above with less code


// If you only have a single-expression what else can you remove
// remove it below


// Finally, an inline closure allows for shorthand for arguments
// Use it  to reduce the duplication


// Just for fun, can you simplify this further


// goal is to allow for the  the below
// let incrementBySeven = makeIncrementer(forIncrement: 7)
// incrementBySeven()
// returns a value of 7
// incrementBySeven() // returns 14



// Q: Closures are _____ types
// A:

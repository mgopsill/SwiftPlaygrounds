import UIKit

// Create a dictionary and iterate through it printing a string with key and value


// Create an Int
// Use a loop with no variable and a range to multiple a number by 10


// Create a loop that iterations from 0 to 60 by 5 at a time


// Create an int at 0, increase the int up to 10, when 10 stop the loop with a conditional


// Create an int at 1, add 2 then check if the int is less than 10, then loop until it is more than 10


//MARK: Conditionals
// Create a int called HP of -1, check if HP is over 10, print OK
// if under 10 print need healing
// if under 0 print KO


// Create a character of z, then use a switch with 3 statements to check it
// Switch should print where it is in alphabet


// copy the above code and make it so the switch accepts a capital Z


// create a tuple of integers
// create a switch that checks a tuple of integers
// if both ints are 0 it should print origin
// if the first int is not 0 it should say first number
// if the second int is 0 it should say second number
// if not say whatever


// copy the above code except the original tuple
// change it so that the First number tells you the first number
// and second number tells you the second
// if both numbers exist it prints both


// declare a integer variable
// write a switch that prints whether the number is positive or negative
// escape the default too

//: Playground - noun: a place where people can play

import UIKit

// create a structure called FixedLengthRange
// that has a variable and constant as it's properties
// then create an instant with a fixed length


// Create a class then create a class that loads that class lazily


// Q: What is a lazy property? Why would you create a lazy property?
// A:
// A:


//MARK: Computed Properties
// Define a structure called point with an x and y integer variable
// Define a structure called size with a height and width
// Define a structure called rect that sets origin as a point, size as a size
// and centre as a point with getters and setters
// the get would return the origin x + width / 2, and origin y + lenght / 2 and return it as a point
// the set would take a newCenter point and set the origin to the new x - width /2 and same for y






// then create a new square with a point and size
// then get, and set it's centre





// Define a class called stepcounter with a variable called steps
// creater observer properties that print the old and new value when steps change
// then create an instance and change the steps





// Create a structure called AudioChannel
// it should have a never changing scale of 1 to 10
// there should be a variable that shows the max volume received of any instance of the structure
// finally there should be a current level value
// when set it should check the new current level - if higher than threshold, cap it
// and if currentl level is higher than the previous max volume update the max volume to new input








// Q: Static variables are only accessible to?
// A: The class itself, not instances of the class.

// Write a function that swaps two integers


// Now write a function that swaps anything


// write a structure called IntStack
// it should have a variable called items of an Array of Ints
// it should have a function called push that takes an Int
// it should append that Int to the array
// it should have a function called pop that
// removes the last item from the array


// rewrite the above so anything could be used in the stack
